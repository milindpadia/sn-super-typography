# Super Typography - Standard Notes Extension

**Super Typography is a layerable theme that provides:**

- Improved typography (mostly meaning better spacing)
- Limiting the width of the editor in a better way than with Editor Width

## Why?

This makes notes look prettier and makes me want to write more. What looks good is of course highly subjective, but to me the added spacing makes notes easier to read.
